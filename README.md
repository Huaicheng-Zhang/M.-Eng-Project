# M.Eng-Project
This project is the M.Eng project I completed during my Master's degree concerning traffic prediction on real-world datasets. The files include testing code, obtained images and the final report. Machine learning methods are improved and combined with complex event processing (CEP) to provide better results. The method is also compared with some traditional models to evaluate its prediction performance.
# File List
Project Code: Programming codes to test the performance of algorithms.  
Results: Images obtained from the project and comparison among different models.  
Project Report: Summarization and related details of the whole project.
