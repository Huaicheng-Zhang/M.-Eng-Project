## Topic
Traffic Event Prediction based on Machine Learning and Complex Event Processing
## Introduction
This project is the M.Eng project I completed during my Master's degree concerning traffic prediction on real-world datasets. The files include testing code, obtained images and the final report. Machine learning methods are improved and combined with complex event processing (CEP) to provide better results. The method is also compared with some traditional models to evaluate its prediction performance.
